The first conference went live in 2017 as “Copenhagen Fintech Week,” a small gathering in Copenhagen harbor, a time in which the fintech sector was still unaware of any hype and jargon. Growing year by year, “Copenhagen Fintech Week” changed its name in 2022 to “Nordic Fintech Week”, to better reflect its role as leading community-driven fintech conference in Northern, that enables growth for the Nordic fintech ecosystem through facilitating global network, partnerships, and knowledge – what we call “Nordic Innovation, Global Scale”. A history of pioneering digital adoption with a strong emphasis on design and user friendliness, an open-minded and e-ready population, a high-trust society with commitment to equality and democracy, close collaborations between public authorities and local startups – all of this has made it possible for the Nordics to be a prime spot for Fintech development. In the true Nordic knowledge-sharing ethos, Nordic Fintech Week is the hotpot to get local and global perspective, the place to create connections and partnerships that will lead the way to the financial industry of tomorrow. Lets build the future of fintech, together at Nordic Fintech Week 2025. Connecting the Nordics to Global Fintech Challenges At Nordic Fintech Week, we believe that understanding global challenges is essential for Nordic fintech companies to thrive on the world stage. That’s why we’ve partnered with the Global Finance and Technology Network (GFTN) to bridge our vibrant innovation ecosystem with global thought leadership. While we champion startups and collaboration here in the nordic countries, GFTN’s Point Zero Forum in Zurich tackles the policies and frameworks shaping the future of global finance. Together, we’re equipping Nordic companies to scale, compete, and lead worldwide. Use code NFW30 for 30% off tickets to the Point Zero Forum and join us in shaping the global fintech landscape.",

Made in the Nordics.Built for Fintech Founders. See you at the Global Fintech Arena, where grit meets opportunity The truth The founders (you) Global Fintech Arena For illustration purposes. All upgrade booths and spots in the arena includes seating. Pricing Limited spots left! Global Fintech Arena -Upgrade Join us at the arena Global Fintech Arena We are looking for Fintechs that are Hop on a call with us Curious about the Arena and how your Fintech might fit in? Let’s chat. We’ll keep it short, sweet, and straight out of the Nordics. They’re right. The work, the waiting, the uncertainty, it’s a mental avalanche. Sometimes it’s pushing through the grind with little to show for it. Sometimes it’s stalling a team dinner because you’re waiting on a maybe. And staying the course when walking away would be easier? That’s the hardest part. We won’t pretend otherwise, and we know you don’t either. At Nordic Fintech Week, we have built a space for the real ones: the hoodie wearing, pitch perfectionists, late night worrying kind of founders and teams. Whether you are chasing your next investor or your newest breakthrough in AI, the Global Fintech Arena is where you’ll move, laugh, think and collide with the kind of serendipity that turns into partnerships, sales calls, and investor coffees. So, bring your laptop, your people, and your A-game. That’s why we have curated a handful of straight-talking, actually useful masterclasses for Fintechs showcasing in the arena. Learn how to own the room with Steve Morris on storytelling, get inside an investor’s head with Mike Sigal, finally understand term sheets (without the legal headache), and walk away with sharper sales tactics from Jamie Reynolds. We are opening the doors this year to The Vertical Rooms. A series of thematic demo sessions focused on the biggest opportunity areas in Fintech. Think ESG & Climate, AI, and Insurance & Pension and more. Fintechs selected for each theme will get to showcase what they’re building to an audience of potential partners, investors, and decision-makers looking for real solutions. And for those ready to pitch, we’re also running a dedicated Investor and Partnership Track, connecting selected fintechs with our investor network and Copenhagen Fintech partners. Now in its 6th edition, the Nordic Fintech Awards celebrate the startups and scaleups redefining finance across the region and spotlighting bold ideas and the people behind them. Finalists are evaluated by a jury of industry leaders, including experts from Citi, Visa, EY, UNDP, Microsoft, and Chainalysis. Recognition here isn’t just a badge, it’s a signal to investors, partners, and the ecosystem that you’re building something that matters. This is where visibility turns into momentum. The best part of Nordic Fintech Week isn’t just the stage, it is who you meet off it. In the Global Fintech Arena, you’re not just getting a booth. You are stepping into a space full of founders deep in the build phase, figuring out sales, chasing funding, and pivoting hard. Just like you are. We have carved out time for real connection: BBQs, padel, coffee chats, and the kind of serendipity that doesn’t happen over LinkedIn. The Launchpad Library is for early-stage fintechs, and those mid-pivot, who want to share what they’re building in a more personal, interactive way. We’re also opening it up in the 2nd edition for book launches. Speakers and ecosystem friends will get space to bring their ideas to life and give their work the airtime it deserves at Nordic Fintech Week. Sometimes the biggest win is just having your own space to show up. At the arena, every Fintech gets a physical spot, because we know being visible matters at a conference. You can join a shared setup with other Fintechs in your vertical (we’ll keep it simple, branded, and easy), or go for a standalone upgrade booth if you want something that’s fully yours (1x2m² and a bit more presence). 3 full access tickets1x2m2 booth* with a custom backdropBranding in the conference app (Brella)Announcement on LinkedInSocial media assets to help you promote your presence – Masterclasses– The Vertical Rooms (Demo Days)– Investor & Partner Showcases– Launchpad Library *GFA standard package includes generic branding setup by Nordic Fintech Week.
