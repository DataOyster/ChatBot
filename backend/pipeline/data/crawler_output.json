About Us | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers About us Get an overview of who we are. Who is behind Nordic Fintech Week? It’s 2016, and the newly formed Copenhagen Fintech team foresees the need for the Nordic financial sector to come together, connect, and exchange knowledge to strengthen the ecosystem and put Nordic fintech on the global radar. The first conference went live in 2017 as “Copenhagen Fintech Week,” a small gathering in Copenhagen harbor, a time in which the fintech sector was still unaware of any hype and jargon. Growing year by year, “Copenhagen Fintech Week” changed its name in 2022 to “Nordic Fintech Week”, to better reflect its role as leading community-driven fintech conference in Northern, that enables growth for the Nordic fintech ecosystem through facilitating global network, partnerships, and knowledge – what we call “Nordic Innovation, Global Scale”. A history of pioneering digital adoption with a strong emphasis on design and user friendliness, an open-minded and e-ready population, a high-trust society with commitment to equality and democracy, close collaborations between public authorities and local startups – all of this has made it possible for the Nordics to be a prime spot for Fintech development. In the true Nordic knowledge-sharing ethos, Nordic Fintech Week is the hotpot to get local and global perspective, the place to create connections and partnerships that will lead the way to the financial industry of tomorrow. Lets build the future of fintech, together at Nordic Fintech Week 2025. Sign up to our newsletter Point Zero Forum X Nordic Fintech Week Connecting the Nordics to Global Fintech Challenges At Nordic Fintech Week, we believe that understanding global challenges is essential for Nordic fintech companies to thrive on the world stage.

Startups | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Made in the Nordics. Built for Fintech Founders. See you at the Global Fintech Arena, where grit meets opportunity Explore the startup program The truth They say starting a company is hard. They’re right. The work, the waiting, the uncertainty, it’s a mental avalanche. Sometimes it’s pushing through the grind with little to show for it. Sometimes it’s stalling a team dinner because you’re waiting on a maybe. And staying the course when walking away would be easier? That’s the hardest part. We won’t pretend otherwise, and we know you don’t either. At Nordic Fintech Week, we have built a space for the real ones: the hoodie wearing, pitch perfectionists, late night worrying kind of founders and teams. Whether you are chasing your next investor or your newest breakthrough in AI, the Global Fintech Arena is where you’ll move, laugh, think and collide with the kind of serendipity that turns into partnerships, sales calls, and investor coffees. So, bring your laptop, your people, and your A-game. It’s time to level up. The founders (you) \"As a startup, it is crucial to bring your product to market and to make the right connections. I think making the right connections is really what hits the nerve at Nordic Fintech Week.\" Lorenz Carl Flechtenmacher Co-Founder, dewa Global Fintech Arena Masterclasses Time is precious, and so is good advice. That’s why we have curated a handful of straight-talking, actually useful masterclasses for Fintechs showcasing in the arena. Learn how to own the room with Steve Morris on storytelling, get inside an investor’s head with Mike Sigal, finally understand term sheets (without the legal headache), and walk away with sharper sales tactics from Jamie Reynolds. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena The Vertical Rooms We are opening the doors this year to The Vertical Rooms. A series of thematic demo sessions focused on the biggest opportunity areas in Fintech. Think ESG & Climate, AI, and Insurance & Pension and more. Fintechs selected for each theme will get to showcase what they’re building to an audience of potential partners, investors, and decision-makers looking for real solutions. And for those ready to pitch, we’re also running a dedicated Investor and Partnership Track, connecting selected fintechs with our investor network and Copenhagen Fintech partners. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena Nordic Fintech Awards Now in its 6th edition, the Nordic Fintech Awards celebrate the startups and scaleups redefining finance across the region and spotlighting bold ideas and the people behind them. Finalists are evaluated by a jury of industry leaders, including experts from Citi, Visa, EY, UNDP, Microsoft, and Chainalysis. Recognition here isn’t just a badge, it’s a signal to investors, partners, and the ecosystem that you’re building something that matters. This is where visibility turns into momentum. Nominations close June 2025. Nordic Community The best part of Nordic Fintech Week isn’t just the stage, it is who you meet off it. In the Global Fintech Arena, you’re not just getting a booth. You are stepping into a space full of founders deep in the build phase, figuring out sales, chasing funding, and pivoting hard. Just like you are. We have carved out time for real connection: BBQs, padel, coffee chats, and the kind of serendipity that doesn’t happen over LinkedIn. Launchpad Library The Launchpad Library is for early-stage fintechs, and those mid-pivot, who want to share what they’re building in a more personal, interactive way. We’re also opening it up in the 2nd edition for book launches. Speakers and ecosystem friends will get space to bring their ideas to life and give their work the airtime it deserves at Nordic Fintech Week.

Who is behind Nordic Fintech Week? It’s 2016, and the newly formed Copenhagen Fintech team foresees the need for the Nordic financial sector to come together, connect, and exchange knowledge to strengthen the ecosystem and put Nordic fintech on the global radar. The first conference went live in 2017 as “Copenhagen Fintech Week,” a small gathering in Copenhagen harbor, a time in which the fintech sector was still unaware of any hype and jargon. Growing year by year, “Copenhagen Fintech Week” changed its name in 2022 to “Nordic Fintech Week”, to better reflect its role as leading community-driven fintech conference in Northern, that enables growth for the Nordic fintech ecosystem through facilitating global network, partnerships, and knowledge – what we call “Nordic Innovation, Global Scale”. A history of pioneering digital adoption with a strong emphasis on design and user friendliness, an open-minded and e-ready population, a high-trust society with commitment to equality and democracy, close collaborations between public authorities and local startups – all of this has made it possible for the Nordics to be a prime spot for Fintech development. In the true Nordic knowledge-sharing ethos, Nordic Fintech Week is the hotpot to get local and global perspective, the place to create connections and partnerships that will lead the way to the financial industry of tomorrow.

Built for Fintech Founders. See you at the Global Fintech Arena, where grit meets opportunity Explore the startup program The truth They say starting a company is hard. They’re right. The work, the waiting, the uncertainty, it’s a mental avalanche. Sometimes it’s pushing through the grind with little to show for it. Sometimes it’s stalling a team dinner because you’re waiting on a maybe. And staying the course when walking away would be easier? That’s the hardest part. We won’t pretend otherwise, and we know you don’t either. At Nordic Fintech Week, we have built a space for the real ones: the hoodie wearing, pitch perfectionists, late night worrying kind of founders and teams. Whether you are chasing your next investor or your newest breakthrough in AI, the Global Fintech Arena is where you’ll move, laugh, think and collide with the kind of serendipity that turns into partnerships, sales calls, and investor coffees. So, bring your laptop, your people, and your A-game. It’s time to level up. The founders (you) \"As a startup, it is crucial to bring your product to market and to make the right connections. I think making the right connections is really what hits the nerve at Nordic Fintech Week.\" Lorenz Carl Flechtenmacher Co-Founder, dewa Global Fintech Arena Masterclasses Time is precious, and so is good advice. That’s why we have curated a handful of straight-talking, actually useful masterclasses for Fintechs showcasing in the arena. Learn how to own the room with Steve Morris on storytelling, get inside an investor’s head with Mike Sigal, finally understand term sheets (without the legal headache), and walk away with sharper sales tactics from Jamie Reynolds. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena The Vertical Rooms We are opening the doors this year to The Vertical Rooms. A series of thematic demo sessions focused on the biggest opportunity areas in Fintech. Think ESG & Climate, AI, and Insurance & Pension and more. Fintechs selected for each theme will get to showcase what they’re building to an audience of potential partners, investors, and decision-makers looking for real solutions. And for those ready to pitch, we’re also running a dedicated Investor and Partnership Track, connecting selected fintechs with our investor network and Copenhagen Fintech partners. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena Nordic Fintech Awards Now in its 6th edition, the Nordic Fintech Awards celebrate the startups and scaleups redefining finance across the region and spotlighting bold ideas and the people behind them. Finalists are evaluated by a jury of industry leaders, including experts from Citi, Visa, EY, UNDP, Microsoft, and Chainalysis. Recognition here isn’t just a badge, it’s a signal to investors, partners, and the ecosystem that you’re building something that matters. This is where visibility turns into momentum.

You are stepping into a space full of founders deep in the build phase, figuring out sales, chasing funding, and pivoting hard. Just like you are. We have carved out time for real connection: BBQs, padel, coffee chats, and the kind of serendipity that doesn’t happen over LinkedIn. Launchpad Library The Launchpad Library is for early-stage fintechs, and those mid-pivot, who want to share what they’re building in a more personal, interactive way. We’re also opening it up in the 2nd edition for book launches.

Built for Fintech Founders. See you at the Global Fintech Arena, where grit meets opportunity Explore the startup program The truth They say starting a company is hard. They’re right. The work, the waiting, the uncertainty, it’s a mental avalanche. Sometimes it’s pushing through the grind with little to show for it. Sometimes it’s stalling a team dinner because you’re waiting on a maybe. And staying the course when walking away would be easier? That’s the hardest part. We won’t pretend otherwise, and we know you don’t either. At Nordic Fintech Week, we have built a space for the real ones: the hoodie wearing, pitch perfectionists, late night worrying kind of founders and teams. Whether you are chasing your next investor or your newest breakthrough in AI, the Global Fintech Arena is where you’ll move, laugh, think and collide with the kind of serendipity that turns into partnerships, sales calls, and investor coffees. So, bring your laptop, your people, and your A-game. It’s time to level up. The founders (you) \"As a startup, it is crucial to bring your product to market and to make the right connections. I think making the right connections is really what hits the nerve at Nordic Fintech Week.\" Lorenz Carl Flechtenmacher Co-Founder, dewa Global Fintech Arena Masterclasses Time is precious, and so is good advice. That’s why we have curated a handful of straight-talking, actually useful masterclasses for Fintechs showcasing in the arena. Learn how to own the room with Steve Morris on storytelling, get inside an investor’s head with Mike Sigal, finally understand term sheets (without the legal headache), and walk away with sharper sales tactics from Jamie Reynolds. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena The Vertical Rooms We are opening the doors this year to The Vertical Rooms. A series of thematic demo sessions focused on the biggest opportunity areas in Fintech. Think ESG & Climate, AI, and Insurance & Pension and more. Fintechs selected for each theme will get to showcase what they’re building to an audience of potential partners, investors, and decision-makers looking for real solutions. And for those ready to pitch, we’re also running a dedicated Investor and Partnership Track, connecting selected fintechs with our investor network and Copenhagen Fintech partners. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena Nordic Fintech Awards Now in its 6th edition, the Nordic Fintech Awards celebrate the startups and scaleups redefining finance across the region and spotlighting bold ideas and the people behind them. Finalists are evaluated by a jury of industry leaders, including experts from Citi, Visa, EY, UNDP, Microsoft, and Chainalysis. Recognition here isn’t just a badge, it’s a signal to investors, partners, and the ecosystem that you’re building something that matters. This is where visibility turns into momentum. Nominations close June 2025. Nordic Community The best part of Nordic Fintech Week isn’t just the stage, it is who you meet off it. In the Global Fintech Arena, you’re not just getting a booth. You are stepping into a space full of founders deep in the build phase, figuring out sales, chasing funding, and pivoting hard. Just like you are. We have carved out time for real connection: BBQs, padel, coffee chats, and the kind of serendipity that doesn’t happen over LinkedIn. Launchpad Library The Launchpad Library is for early-stage fintechs, and those mid-pivot, who want to share what they’re building in a more personal, interactive way. We’re also opening it up in the 2nd edition for book launches. Speakers and ecosystem friends will get space to bring their ideas to life and give their work the airtime it deserves at Nordic Fintech Week. Exclusive to Fintechs in the Arena A Physical Spot Sometimes the biggest win is just having your own space to show up. At the arena, every Fintech gets a physical spot, because we know being visible matters at a conference.

How new generations are driving change in the Nordics | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers How new generations are driving change in the Nordics The payments landscape in the Nordics is changing fast. High digital maturity, evolving consumer expectations, and rapid innovation are reshaping how people pay, save, and interact with financial services. Younger generations such as Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennials are leading this shift, setting new standards for convenience, control, and personalization. Digital payments are now the default In the Nordics, digital payments have become the everyday norm. More than 90% of consumers have made an online purchase, and mobile is now the primary channel for both shopping and payments. Local wallets like MobilePay, Swish, and Vipps are as familiar as credit cards. Half of all consumers use mobile payments in-store. This behavior reflects a broader cultural expectation: people want to manage their finances independently, using trusted devices and platforms. Nexi’s Nordic Payments 2025 – H1 Preview study confirms that this trend is consistent across age groups. What younger generations expect Gen Z and millennials consider digital banking essential. More than half say it is a top priority when choosing a financial institution. They expect mobile onboarding, personalized services, and intuitive interfaces. Gen Alpha, the youngest cohort, is already engaging with financial services through teen-focused products that offer gamified learning, parental controls, and simplified digital tools. These generations have grown up with smartphones and instant access to information. They value speed, transparency, and relevance. Generic offerings don’t hold their attention. They want tools that help them learn, manage money, and make informed decisions. Many are skeptical of traditional banks and quick to switch providers if expectations aren’t met. From cards to digital ecosystems The payment card is evolving into a gateway for broader financial experiences. Today’s users expect instant digital issuing, travel perks, buy now pay later options, and sustainability features. Neobanks and fintechs have raised the bar for speed and mobile-first convenience. Traditional banks are adapting, often through modular platforms that allow faster response to changing demands. Nordic consumers move fluidly between online and in-store shopping. Electronics and clothing are typically bought online, while groceries and daily essentials remain in-store purchases. However, poor checkout experiences still lead to abandoned carts. Nexi’s report highlights the importance of frictionless payments across all channels. Security and trust remain critical As digital payments become more widespread, security and trust are top priorities. While many embrace mobile payments for their ease, others hesitate due to concerns about data privacy and fraud. Features like real-time notifications, advanced fraud prevention, and easy card controls are now expected. Providers must simplify complexity while maintaining strong security. Solutions that balance usability with protection help build and sustain consumer trust. The future of payments is increasingly shaped by data Across Europe and beyond, financial institutions are using behavioral insights to improve user experiences, reduce friction, and deliver more relevant services. Personalization is becoming standard, especially among younger consumers who expect intuitive interfaces, tailored rewards, and flexible payment options. Recent industry reports show that features like gamified learning, real-time notifications, and embedded loyalty programs are gaining traction. These tools help users make informed decisions and build financial confidence. For banks and fintechs, the challenge is to deliver these experiences at scale while maintaining trust and security. Platforms that support modular APIs, instant onboarding, and customizable features are helping financial providers respond quickly to changing expectations. Whether it’s offering teen-focused products or ESG-linked spending tools, the goal is the same: to make payments smarter, more engaging, and more aligned with individual needs. Collaboration and ecosystems shape the future Meeting consumer expectations requires collaboration. The most successful banks and fintechs are those that integrate, adapt, and innovate together. Modular platforms, open APIs, and partnership-driven models enable faster development and better customer outcomes. The focus is shifting toward ecosystems where value is shared, and innovation is collective. Simplifying payments for people and banks As payment technology evolves in the Nordics, the real value is seen in how it makes everyday transactions easier for people and enables banks to deliver better experiences. By focusing on simplicity and trust, the industry is helping everyone manage their finances with greater confidence.

Nordic Roots, Global Ambition: Going Beyond Compliance to Build Resilient Growth | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Nordic Roots, Global Ambition: Going Beyond Compliance to Build Resilient Growth By Daniel Alter, Chief Risk Officer at Enfuce The Nordic region has long approached compliance not as red tape, but as a springboard for innovation. By embedding high standards early and nurturing a culture of collaboration, it laid the foundations for digital infrastructures that are now seamlessly woven into everyday life. Consider Denmark’s MitID , the national digital identity system. Trusted by over 5 million people, 96% of the Danish population over the age of 15, it allows citizens to securely access public services, manage bank accounts, sign documents, and verify their identity across a wide range of digital platforms. Similarly, Sweden’s BankID supports 8 million users, 99.9% of people aged 18 to 67, and in 2024 alone enabled 7.6 billion identifications and digital signatures. These platforms are far more than security tools. They are national trust infrastructure: unlocking access, driving inclusion, and accelerating the adoption of digital services at scale. And they show something powerful: compliance, when done right, doesn’t slow innovation, it unlocks it. It builds the trust and stability that allow technology to scale responsibly and sustainably. The challenge: borderless risks demand borderless resilience The Nordic model is built on collaboration. Banks, fintechs, and regulators have long worked together to create unified infrastructure and shared standards that strengthen the entire ecosystem. But today’s financial system is global, and so are its risks. Financial crime, from fraud to money laundering, is evolving faster than any single regulator can contain. It is more sophisticated, more scalable, and more dangerous than ever, with criminal networks exploiting every gap between jurisdictions. Addressing these challenges requires more than regional defenses. It demands resilience that crosses borders: replacing isolated compliance efforts with shared frameworks, and shifting from reactive monitoring to coordinated, real-time collaboration across companies, regulators, and markets. At Enfuce , we believe this Nordic approach, compliance-first and collaboration-led, is no longer just a regional advantage. It is a global necessity. Our philosophy: compliance as foundation, risk management as enabler Compliance is often misunderstood. To many, it represents cost, friction, and delay, and too often it’s reduced to a box-ticking exercise. But experience across the Nordics, and at Enfuce, shows the opposite. When treated as a strategic foundation rather than an afterthought, compliance becomes an engine of growth. It is not just about meeting today’s requirements, it is about building the structures that allow businesses to adapt, anticipate, and scale. The reason is simple: global ambition cannot succeed on shaky ground. A single regulatory failure can halt expansion, erode trust, and irreparably damage reputations. Companies that see compliance as part of their core strategy, however, enter markets faster, gain regulator confidence, and build resilience that lasts. This belief is why we don’t just talk about compliance as strategy, we prove it in practice. Our pledge: Fortitude as proof point To take this philosophy from principle to practice, we launched the Fortitude Pledge : Enfuce’s promise to raise the bar on compliance and accountability. Through the Fortitude Pledge we commit to: ● Screen 100% of card transactions ● Flag 100% of high-risk activity ● Block 100% of prohibited payments ● Report 100% of suspicious cases ● Train 100% of our employees in AML/CTF best practices Most importantly we are putting 100% of our efforts into raising the bar and combating financial crime. The Fortitude Pledge proves that Nordic principles can be turned into global standards. With Allpay as our first signatory, we are calling on other financial institutions, businesses, and industry leaders to move beyond box-ticking compliance and join us in setting a new benchmark for trust. Global ambition: exporting Fortitude with Enfuce The future of finance will not be defined by speed alone, but by the ability to scale securely, sustainably, and with integrity. That is the standard Enfuce is taking to a global stage. Share article LinkedIn Blog Press FAQ Speakers 2025 Our Terms and Conditions © Copyright NFW all rights reserved",

Reassessing fintech dominance in the Nordics, from first movers to best-integrators | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Reassessing fintech dominance in the Nordics, from first movers to best-integrators Are the Nordics maintaining their dominance in the European fintech revolution? The signs are positive and point to an ecosystem of sleek cards, instant transfers and cashless cafés where innovation quietly becomes accepted and expected infrastructure. The Nordics were early and relentless, quickly turning good ideas into nationwide utilities. As the rails evolve again, the more relevant question isn’t whether banks or fintechs “win,” but whether the region can keep turning collaboration into a competitive edge. The secret sauce wasn’t one app or a specific technological innovation; it was productising trust leveraging several components: Decades of high digital literacy Cooperative banking cultures, National digital identity schemes Together, this created a canvas where complex financial plumbing could be abstracted into everyday magic. A population hungry for seamless, secure and speedy digital solutions was kept satisfied by a progressive wave of digital infrastructure – and enabled by impressive connectivity access and one of the highest smartphone penetrations anywhere globally [1] . Bringing these digital dreams to life For example, Vipps in Norway, and MobilePay in Denmark didn’t merely make peer-to-peer payments easy; they normalised real-time, low-friction experiences at national scale. Crucially, even when startups owned the front end, banks supplied balance-sheet strength, licenses, and compliance backbones. It looked like disruption, but it was also orchestration—multiple actors performing to a shared tempo. This leads us to the next act. Money in motion is fragmenting across more endpoints than ever. Payment volumes are increasingly flowing away from banks and towards Fintechs. That line captures a structural shift. Volumes used to sit neatly inside bank-owned cards, accounts, and clearing systems. Today, flows route through wallets, super-app checkouts, embedded finance in marketplaces, and account-to-account rails abstracted behind APIs. Consumers don’t think about issuers and acquirers; they think about “tap, send, done.” Fintechs own that moment—and often the data exhaust that follows. Nordic banks, more than most, are comfortable as utility-grade platforms. They hold licenses, deposits, compliance capabilities, and risk models that remain hard to replicate. Many fintechs in the region still anchor on bank infrastructure—directly or via network partners—for settlement finality, KYC, safeguarding, and float management. The centre of gravity, however, is moving toward whoever controls the experience layer and the orchestration logic behind it. So, while the Nordics remain in a strong position, the region’s edge is narrowing. Instant payments, open banking, and digital identity are now global playbooks. Markets from the UK to Brazil to India have scaled comparable rails and cultivated aggressive fintech ecosystems. The Nordic advantage is evolving from first mover to best-integrator. What does “happy symbiosis” look like in practice? Banks become programmable. Think API-first credit, real-time disbursements, and compliance-as-a-service that fintechs can snap into. Fintechs become regulated-adjacent. They lean into partnerships, share telemetry, and design for supervisory visibility from day one. Networks stitch it together. Push-to-account and account-to-account corridors blur card and non-card boundaries, letting value move to where users are—apps, wallets, platforms—without frictions the user can feel. In this model, the battleground is context and consent. Whoever assembles the cleanest data, earns permission to act on it, and returns value quickly will be in a position to win the next increment of payment flow. Nordic players—incumbent and insurgent—are well suited to this because the culture already prizes secure interoperability over walled gardens. The Nordics weren’t alone in spearheading this technological revolution, but they were early, disciplined, and pragmatic. Are they still leading? In the art of turning collaboration into competitive advantage, yes. The ground is shifting, but this is a region that has learned to pour the concrete while it walks on it. The result is not banks versus fintechs; it is an ecosystem where trust moves at the speed of software, and where winners make safe feel simple, again and again.

The Unseen Balance: Innovation, Security and the Power of Identity | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers The Unseen Balance: Innovation, Security and the Power of Identity By Jacob Ideskog, CTO, Curity Nordic fintechs have helped set the global standard for digital finance – but the very innovation that pushed the region forward is now creating new pressures: fragmented systems, escalating compliance demands and growing external dependencies. And alongside these comes intensifying pressure: to safeguard data, prevent fraud, comply with regulations and maintain customer trust in a world where digital threats evolve daily. Every great construction, however, has a hidden force at play – something beneath the surface that holds everything together. Very few crossing a bridge think about the grade of steel or the engineering calculations behind its stability, but without them the whole structure would fail. In digital finance, that hidden force is identity. It doesn’t make headlines or wow customers directly, but it quietly ensures that innovation can scale, privacy can be enforced and trust can be sustained. The Chaos of Innovation Without Identity Yet even in regions that lead, innovation often comes with hidden costs. The faster organizations build, the more complicated their systems become. Every new digital service adds another moving part. On their own these elements bring agility, but collectively they create a system that is increasingly difficult to secure. Without a unifying layer, vulnerabilities multiply, oversight weakens and the environment becomes fragile. Growth accelerates, but the foundation beneath it is stretched thin. At the same time, the internal complexity grows heavier. Data is scattered across silos, undermining transparency and potentially creating blind spots that make compliance and monitoring harder. Customers encounter fragmented user experiences as security policies and login flows vary across channels, eroding trust in even the strongest brands. And regulators demand consistency that is nearly impossible to enforce when the underlying architecture is fragmented. The result is a paradox of progress: fintechs appear to be advancing faster than ever, yet the unseen complexity threatens to hold them back. Identity as the Architectural Anchor So what restores balance in this environment of complexity? Identity. It is more than a login page or a back-office function. When placed at the center of digital architecture, identity becomes the unifying layer that connects systems, governs access, and enforces rules consistently across every channel. Anchoring innovation in identity means data can be linked to people and entities, rather than scattered across silos. Privacy protections can be applied across the infrastructure, not bolted on at the edges. Most importantly, trust can grow in step with innovation. When customers know their data is handled responsibly, they are more willing to adopt new services. When regulators see consistency in enforcement, compliance becomes less of a burden. And when organizations can control access uniformly, they gain resilience in the face of disruption. Beyond the Customer: Expanding the Scope of Identity The conversation about identity often begins with customers, and customer identity and access management (CIAM) is indeed critical for enabling personalized, seamless and secure experiences. But customers are only part of the story. Workforce identity ensures that employees and contractors can securely access the tools they need, while also reducing insider risk. Partner identity management has become just as important, as financial institutions increasingly collaborate with fintechs, third-party providers and even regulators. Trust must extend across organizational boundaries. And then there are non-human identities : APIs, services, bots and now AI-driven agents. These actors are proliferating at a pace and each of them requires authentication and authorization. Ignoring them is no longer an option; doing so leaves vulnerabilities wide open. Managing identity comprehensively across these dimensions is the only way to build systems that can withstand the pressure of scale. Identity as the New Frontline Identity is not just an internal architecture issue. It is increasingly a question of data sovereignty and resilience. At Nordic Fintech Week, Curity’s CEO Gustaf Sahlman will explore this in his keynote Identity, the Digital Kill Switch – Why Digital Sovereignty is More Critical Than Ever . His talk highlights a growing reality: in a shifting geopolitical landscape, relying on foreign providers for critical digital infrastructure exposes financial systems to external pressures and risks. Across Europe, governments are already taking action, from phasing out proprietary collaboration tools to investing in sovereign cloud platforms. This shift places identity at the frontline, where trust, regulations and infrastructure converge. The Future of Fintech Depends on Balance Digital transformation is not a project with an end date. It is an ongoing reality. For the Nordics to maintain their leadership in fintech, innovation must be matched with equally strong foundations of privacy, security and trust. Identity is that foundation – the unseen balancing power that allows progress without crumbling under its own complexity. Fintech innovation will always push forward. The real question is whether your foundation can keep up. With identity at the center, it can.

Data Strategy Just Got Real. | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers The AI Act Is Here. Data Strategy Just Got Real. For years, data has been called the new oil. But in financial services, it’s been closer to crude, valuable, yes, but hard to refine, siloed, and often more liability than asset. Now, with the arrival of the EU’s AI Act, the stakes have changed. Regulation isn’t just about compliance anymore. It’s about survival. The Act demands that organisations not only know where their data lives, but also understand how it’s being used, what’s powering their AI models, and who is responsible when something goes wrong. According to Jason Yung, Head of Data Strategy at AWS for EMEA, most firms aren’t ready. “When we ask organisations what’s stopping them from becoming data-driven, they’ll usually point to data quality,” he says. “But often, the real issue is a lack of alignment around what they’re trying to do with the data in the first place.” This disconnect between data ambition and execution is widespread. Many institutions have centralised data teams and invested heavily in storage, data lakes, warehouses, cloud infrastructure, but are still struggling to translate that into business value. The issue? Strategy. “Centralising data teams creates bottlenecks,” Yung explains. “But decentralising too much leads to duplication, inefficiency, and shadow IT. What’s needed is a hybrid model, multidisciplinary teams that align on purpose and outcomes first.” From Platform Obsession to Product Thinking There’s also a shift underway in how firms approach technology. Many still operate with a platform-first mindset, collecting features without clear use cases. Yung challenges that. “Organisations need to stop thinking about platforms and start thinking about products,” he says. “Treat AI and data like a product, with ingredients, purpose, and transparency.” The AI Act reinforces this shift. Explainability, traceability, and auditability aren’t optional, they’re required. And that means the way organisations build, deploy, and scale AI must fundamentally change. Generative AI: More Than Content Generative AI isn’t just about producing text or images, its real utility in financial services may be operational. From summarising compliance documents to automating metadata analysis and lineage tracking, Gen AI is increasingly being used to reduce the administrative load of data governance. “Generative AI allows you to scan your entire data estate,” says Yung. “It can summarise what data is being used, where it’s being stored, and whether it aligns with governance policies. It becomes a lightweight governance layer, not replacing human oversight, but augmenting it.” This shift unlocks efficiency while reinforcing compliance. It also sets the foundation for deploying AI agents, self-operating systems that act on real-time data. Agentic AI: From Hype to Use Case In financial services, autonomous AI agents are already gaining traction. Use cases include fraud detection, hyper-personalisation, and intelligent automation of workflows. “If a customer is logged into a banking app and hovering over personal loans, an AI agent can detect that in real time and trigger a push notification with a tailored offer,” says Yung. “You don’t need to pre-build separate workflows, the agent adapts dynamically to user behaviour.” The same logic can be applied to fraud. An agent that detects unusual purchase behaviour—say, a sudden shift from grocery transactions to high-value goods—can alert a fraud investigator instantly. These agents are reusable, trainable, and far more flexible than traditional rule-based systems. “The beauty of agentic AI is that it’s not locked into one function,” Yung explains. “The same architecture can support personalisation, fraud detection, or compliance, reducing costs and increasing agility.” Collaboration, Not Consolidation The AI Act also forces a rethinking of collaboration. Traditional data sharing often relied on fragile integrations or manual processes. But new technologies, from synthetic data to clean rooms, now allow financial institutions to collaborate securely, without exposing raw data. “We’re seeing industry consortiums use AI to scan multiple data platforms across cloud providers,” says Yung. “AI can identify common patterns, generate secure joins, and surface insights, all without compromising privacy.” This creates new opportunities to tackle industry-wide challenges, such as fraud, systemic risk, or credit profiling, in ways that were technically impossible, or legally risky, just a few years ago. AWS’s Role: Building the Infrastructure for Choice Rather than selling a single platform, AWS offers over 250 services—“LEGO blocks,” as Yung calls them—that allow customers to build exactly what they need.

From money laundering and fraud to cybercrime and insider threats, the complexity and scale of financial crime is growing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation are increasingly seen as a ‘must have’ in this fight, offering speed, scale and precision that manual processes simply can’t match. But as with any powerful tool, the key lies in how it’s used. Getting the balance right between automation, AI and human oversight is not just a technical challenge, it’s a strategic imperative and requires excellent change management for any new processes. The Expanding Battlefield of Financial Crime The financial services industry is facing challenges on all fronts. Regulatory expectations are rising, criminals are becoming more sophisticated, and customer demands for seamless digital experiences are intensifying. Traditional rule-based systems for detecting suspicious activity are no longer enough. They generate too many false positives, miss nuanced patterns and struggle to adapt to new threats. Many financial institutions do not have an overall company-wide view of financial crime or the ability to fully examine patterns across all data points. This is where AI comes in. Machine learning models can analyse vast volumes of data in real time, identify anomalies and learn from evolving patterns. Natural language processing (NLP) can sift through unstructured data (emails, chat logs, documents) to detect hidden risks. And predictive analytics can flag potential issues before they escalate. Where AI Can Make the Biggest Impact AI has the potential to transform financial crime detection and prevention across several key areas: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) AI can dramatically improve transaction monitoring by reducing false positives and identifying complex laundering patterns that span multiple accounts, geographies and transaction types. It can also enhance customer risk scoring by incorporating behavioural data and external sources. Fraud Detection Real-time fraud detection powered by AI can spot unusual behaviour, such as rapid fund transfers, location mismatches, or device anomalies and trigger alerts instantly. AI models can adapt to new fraud tactics faster than traditional systems. Sanctions Screening AI can improve name matching and reduce false hits in sanctions screening by using fuzzy logic and contextual analysis. This is especially useful in cross-border payments where name variations are common. Insider Threats and Cybercrime AI can monitor employee behaviour and system access patterns to detect potential insider threats. It can also help identify phishing attempts, malware and other cyber risks by analysing network traffic and user behaviour. Automation vs. Human Judgment: Finding the Right Mix While AI and automation solutions can automate and accelerate many aspects of financial crime management, it’s not a standalone silver bullet. There are critical areas where human expertise remains essential: Contextual Decision-Making : AI can flag anomalies, but understanding the context, especially in complex cases, often requires human judgment. For example, we have clients who are having their relationship managers train AI for certain word and acronym association with different clients. Regulatory Interpretation : Compliance isn’t just about ticking boxes. It involves interpreting evolving regulations and applying them to specific scenarios, which AI alone can’t do. Regulatory oversight requires evidencing through in person meetings, also applicable to internal audit oversight. Customer Interaction : When a transaction is flagged or an account is frozen, customers need clear, empathetic communication. This is where human support is irreplaceable, and often demanded by customers, so there needs to be a frictionless offramp to in person support. Model Governance : AI models need to be trained, tested and monitored. Bias, drift, and explainability are ongoing concerns that require skilled oversight. This also links to both external regulatory and internal oversight and evidencing. The goal isn’t to replace people with machines; it’s to empower teams with smarter tools and free them from repetitive tasks so they can focus on higher-value work. Embedding AI in the Right Structures and Processes Just as important as the technology itself is how it’s embedded into the organisation. AI needs to be part of a broader strategy that includes: Cross-functional collaboration : Risk, compliance, IT and operations teams must work together to define use cases, validate models and manage change. Agile workflows : AI tools should be integrated into flexible workflows that allow for rapid adaptation to new threats and regulatory changes. The workflows must adhere to the bank policies, procedures, escalation paths and associated stages and steps. Data governance : High-quality, well-governed data is the foundation of effective AI. Banks must invest in data management, quality assurance and privacy controls. Continuous learning : AI models should be continuously updated with new data and feedback to stay effective. This requires a culture of experimentation and improvement. The Compliance Challenge: Automating Without Overstepping One of the biggest hurdles in applying AI to financial crime is compliance. Regulators and internal audit teams are increasingly scrutinising how AI is used, especially in areas like AML and fraud detection. Transparency, explainability and auditability are non-negotiables. Banks must ensure that AI-driven decisions can be explained to regulators, customers and internal stakeholders. This means investing in model documentation, validation frameworks and governance processes. It also means being cautious about over-automation. For example, automatically freezing accounts based on AI alerts without human review could lead to reputational damage and customer dissatisfaction. A tiered approach, where low-risk alerts are handled automatically and high-risk cases are escalated for human review given certain triggers, can help strike the right balance. Looking Ahead: Resilience Through Smart Integration As financial crime continues to evolve, resilience will depend on how well banks can integrate AI and automation into their broader risk and compliance strategies. This isn’t just about technology, it’s about people, processes and culture. The most successful organisations will be those that: Use AI and automation to enhance, not replace human expertise. Build agile, adaptable workflows that can quickly respond to new threats. Invest in data quality and governance as a strategic asset. Maintain transparency and trust with regulators and customers. In times of uncertainty, the ability to detect and respond to financial crime quickly and effectively is a competitive advantage. AI and automation can be a game-changer, but only if it’s applied thoughtfully, with the right mix of automation and human insight.

The Future is Modular | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers The Future is Modular Kustom in partnership with Nordic Fintech Week What does a software company, a contemporary artist, and a global fashion brand have in common? A few things, sure. But honestly – not that much. As more and more of our lives move online, the patterns that once defined digital behavior have splintered. There was a time you could talk about “internet culture” as if it was one thing. Today, the digital world is as fragmented, vibrant, and unpredictable as the physical one. That fragmentation has real implications for how products and services are built. Scalability still matters – we’re fans too – but “one size fits all” almost never works. A merchant selling pant s faces a flood of returns compared to one selling watches. A software merchant doesn’t worry about shipping. A fireworks seller needs age verification. A payment method essential in one market might be irrelevant in another. A more diverse market demands more adaptable products. And adaptability isn’t something you can bolt on at the end – it has to be built into the foundation. For us at Kustom, that foundation is collaboration. Kustom, formerly known as Klarna Checkout, delivers a checkout solution for merchants, and our role is to connect the partners and services that help them get the most out of it. When someone makes a purchase, money needs to move, products need to be shipped, loyalty points registered, and customer details stored. We orchestrate that flow, making the experience seamless for the shopper and straightforward for the merchant. If we’re the best conductor, that doesn’t make us the best at last-mile delivery in Southern Europe – so we partner with those who are. One example is our collaboration with Stripe, which powers the “engine” of the Kustom car when it comes to payment processing. And this logic applies far beyond checkout. A future-proof digital ecosystem isn’t made up of single monoliths trying to serve every need; it’s built from networks of specialists, each contributing their strengths. The real value comes from how these services connect, and that’s where collaboration turns complexity into opportunity. In a modular future, friction falls away. Choice expands. And solutions fit the problem, instead of forcing the problem to fit the solution. The internet is no longer one culture – it’s billions. And the companies that succeed in the next decade will be those that treat that complexity not as a bug, but as the main feature. If you want to talk about e-commerce, partnerships, what Nordic consumers value (and get frustrated by) when shopping online, or what it’s like to build an entirely new company from an already market-leading position, come find us at Nordic Fintech Week in Copenhagen. We’ll see you there. Share article LinkedIn Blog Press FAQ Speakers 2025 Our Terms and Conditions © Copyright NFW all rights reserved",

Open Question: Can Financial Institutions Be “Everything Everywhere All at Once”? | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Open Question: Can Financial Institutions Be “Everything Everywhere All at Once”? By Thomas Krogh Jensen, CEO, Copenhagen Fintech For many years, the simple mantra of strategic logic has been: choose your fight . Be the orchestrator, the integrator, the infrastructure, or the silent contributor – but never all at once. Focus was the gospel. Scale and specialization were the path to survival. But what if that’s yesterday’s playbook? The financial world is being rewired at a structural level. Cloud and APIs have blown apart the cost of integration. AI and autonomous agents are collapsing service and operating models, turning what used to be product verticals into fluid, reconfigurable modules. Regulation – especially in Europe – is not just allowing, but actively forcing access and openness. Add the rise of stablecoins, CBDCs, and DeFi, and the very architecture of money is no longer fixed. If the rules of the game have changed, do financial institutions still need to choose one role? Or is the old strategic wisdom collapsing under the weight of new technological possibilities? As ecosystem orchestrators , banks can dream of dominating customer journeys – owning the interface, curating ecosystems, and monetizing network effects. One way to do that is the ‘Financial SuperApp’. In this role ‘Eco’ is central. As traditional integrators , they can still hold control of the value chain, managing risk end-to-end. Partnerships are still essential, but only the ones that support the overall (tech)strategy of the institution. In this role ‘Ego’ is central’. As embedded contributors , they can distribute their products invisibly into other ecosystems, scaling without owning the customer. Less ‘Ego’. The institutions will supply other brands/platforms ecosystems. As infrastructure providers , they can step back and monetize the rails, the compliance stack, and the liquidity backbone. Much less ‘Ego’. Less exciting, but a position that established institutions excel at, and that might be in high demand. The orthodoxy says: pick one. Reality might say: play them all. Because the new technology stack does not force a single identity. A bank could be an orchestrator in one vertical, embedded in another, and infrastructure in yet another. The boundaries are porous, the roles interchangeable. Cloud and AI don’t demand focus; they enable multiplicity. But here’s the dilemma: if everything is possible, does anything matter? Strategic discipline used to come from scarcity. From hard choices. From trade-offs. Today, the illusion of infinite optionality risks creating institutions that spread widely, but go shallow. A financial institution that tries to be everywhere may end up being nowhere in particular. The future financial institution may not be defined by which role it plays, but by how deliberately it moves between them . Not fixed identities, but fluid archetypes. Not single bets, but portfolios of roles, tuned by context, geography, and partnerships. The question is no longer “Which role should we choose?” The question is: Do we dare to be many things at once – and still matter? Disclaimer: I know I am simplifying things here. The purpose of this post is just to get a discussion started. Can (and should) a financial institution play multiple roles? Are they prepared to do that? Traditional wisdom might not apply anymore, or will it become even more important to ‘go deep’? And by the way, if you have not seen the movie , it’s… well, interesting!

Why the Nordics Matter More Than Ever | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Why the Nordics Matter More Than Ever Peak3 Partners with Nordic Fintech Week to Power the Insurance Track We’ve always admired the Nordics. This is a region that leads the world in how insurance operates and how society embraces new technology. From MitID to MobilePay, and the widespread use of straight-through processing (STP) in claims, the Nordic way of working is clear: work smarter, not harder. Trust is also part of the DNA here. In many cases, an oral agreement holds as much weight as a written one. That high-trust culture shows up in the numbers: insurers in the region run combined ratios in the mid-80s and expense ratios around 15%, far ahead of many markets where those figures are worse off. With numbers like these, the Nordics was not exactly our obvious first stop for Peak3. But here is what’s changed: We have learned that even in such a high-performing market, challenges persist. Legacy systems are still common, and GenAI adoption lags behind global peers. Only 19% of Nordic white-collar workers use it weekly (versus 61% globally), missing out on a projected €60 billion in potential annual productivity gains. That mix – operational excellence but room to modernise – makes the region a fascinating place to share what we have seen work in other parts of the world and to explore together how those ideas could fit here. That is why we are excited to be partnering with Nordic Fintech Week, where we are curating the insurance track. Across our sessions, we’ll dive into three big themes: Cracking the Nordic Paradox: Leaders in Affinity, Laggards in Embedded? Between 40% and 60% of personal lines P&C contracts in the Nordics come through partners like banks, unions, and OEMs. The propositions are strong, but the tech behind them often does not go far enough to really engage customers or grow their lifetime value. In other markets, companies like Grab and Companjon have shown how the right tech can help sell multiple policies per customer each year, at low acquisition cost. So why not here? Read our Embedded Insurance Whitepaper Series Gen Z Doesn’t Care About Insurance – Not Yet Plenty of young people in the Nordics are still underinsured. For example, uptake of accident and contents insurance among under-30s remains low, with affordability and awareness key barriers. Profitability is often the reason given, but companies like Snack have found ways to make it work. See our Accumulator Whitepaper to learn how Be AI-Ready: Building a Future-Proof, Customer-Centric Core AI is here to stay. We aim to share real-world examples of AI working in insurance and sit down with Nordic leaders to discuss how they are tackling legacy and preparing their core systems for the future. Read our AI in Insurance Whitepaper and register for our roundtable Sustainability is also top of mind for many insurers. As the industry faces increasing pressure to deliver on ESG goals, we’re seeing more focus on how IT can drive sustainable outcomes. For a deeper dive, check out our recent publication on Key Levers for Sustainable Insurance IT , which explores practical steps insurers can take to make their operations greener and more resilient. In short, the Nordics have plenty to be proud of. But to stay ahead, they must evolve embedded engagement, reach the next generation, and leap into AI. Join Peak3 and industry peers at Nordic Fintech Week to explore how to turn these challenges into opportunities.

Unlocking Europe: Why Digital Identity Should Be a Top Priority | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Unlocking Europe: Why Digital Identity Should Be a Top Priority By Thomas Krogh Jensen, CEO, Copenhagen Fintech Unlocking Europe: Why Digital Identity Should Be a Top Priority Digital Identity is emerging not just as a regulatory requirement, but as the ’linchpin’ of the digital services economy. Especially in financial services, where trust, compliance, and interoperability are foundational. The European Union’s eIDAS regulation and the European Business Wallet (EBW) initiative are accelerating this shift, offering secure, reusable, and interoperable identity infrastructure across borders. But the implications extend far beyond compliance. Digital identity is becoming the gateway for innovation, embedded finance, and agent-based economies globally. A New Identity-Centric Financial Paradigm Imagine this scenario: A consumer or SME wants to access a pan-European investment tool powered by their AI financial agent. To function optimally, this agent requires secure, ongoing access to personal financial data – from transaction histories and credit profiles to investment behaviors. This is where Open Finance meets identity. I know that the Financial Data Access (FiDA) framework is still work-in-progress but imagine the possibilities this piece of regulation can unleash. With the growth of agentic AI systems, users must consent to share sensitive data with third-party tools continuously. Digital identity becomes the secure gatekeeper: verifying both user (and agent?), ensuring legitimacy, and enforcing consent dynamically. Identity Reusability: Fueling the Agent Economy For both consumers and businesses, digital identity reduces friction. It allows a verified identity to unlock services across platforms – banking, insurance, tax services, or maybe ESG verification tools – without redundant onboarding. In agentic ecosystems, where AI advisors may transact or apply for financial products autonomously, this becomes critical. Identity verification must be granular, revocable, and traceable – enabling agents to act, but within defined governance rails. Cross-Border Financial Services: A Unified European Market eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity Wallet aim to give every EU citizen and business a recognized digital identity. When implemented fully, this can further accelerate cross-border finance: SMEs can apply for credit or set up services in another member state with much less friction. Consumers can much easier purchase financial products beyond their national borders. Digital identity becomes not only a passport but also a compliance tool. Embedding AML/KYC protocols into the identity fabric and enabling streamlined onboarding without repeated documentation. Fraud Reduction: Identity as a Security Asset Secure customer onboarding remains a top challenge. AI-driven fraud and synthetic identity creation are growing threats. A harmonized digital identity framework can mitigate these risks by embedding strong verification, device-level authentication, and behavioral biometrics. Identity frameworks that interoperate across national and institutional boundaries will be a key ingredient in fighting bad actors and financial crime. Nordic Leadership, European Integration The Nordics have already demonstrated global best practices in digital identity. Thiat is a well known fact. These systems have nearly universal coverage, are trusted by citizens, and used across public and private sectors. Yet, despite domestic success, even greater value can be unlocked through region-wide (global?) interoperability. The next frontier is not national excellence, but cross-border compatibility. Globally, markets like India (Aadhaar + UPI), Singapore (MyInfo), and Australia (myGovID) show how government-backed identity infrastructure can catalyze fintech innovation and inclusion. Strategic Outlook for Nordic Fintech Week At Nordic Fintech Week, we’ll explore how digital identity will shape the future of embedded finance, agentic AI, and cross-border banking and insurance plus much more. As the financial world shifts from static platforms to dynamic, intelligent services, digital identity will be the universal key. Join us in Copenhagen and be part of the conversation.

Will It Be Yours or Someone Else’s? | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers In 5 Years, Everyone Will Have an Expert Financial Advisor working 24/7. Will It Be Yours or Someone Else’s? By Thomas Krogh Jensen, CEO, Copenhagen Fintech In one of my recent posts on LinkedIn, I explored the vision of a “Lovable-for-Finance” . A seamless, intelligent interface that empowers everyday people to manage their finances simply by stating their goals. “I want to be debt-free in 24 months,” or “Help me grow €50K for my child’s education.” The user provides intent; the system does the rest. That is not science fiction. It is a preview of what’s now rapidly becoming possible – thanks in large part to two converging forces: Agentic AI and the EU’s Financial Data Access (FiDA) Regulation (yes. I am aware that there are still uncertaintie and a longer timeline – but we will get there and the faster the better). From Advice to Autonomous Optimization Financial services today are structured around advice: dashboards, calculators, and (for many) human interaction. Execution is mostly left to the user. But agentic AI marks a radical departure from this paradigm. It turns the financial services experience from one of guidance to one of autonomous action . In the emerging model, you describe a goal and your financial agent: Gathers a real-time, consented view of your finances – across banks, credit cards, pensions, insurance, and more. Designs a viable strategy to meet your objective. Executes the plan autonomously – moving money, reallocating savings, optimizing credit or insurance arrangements. Continuously monitors and adjusts the plan as circumstances evolve. This is not just about better advice. This is about removing the gap between decision and execution. And it fundamentally reshapes what financial services mean to consumers and businesses alike. FiDA: The Data Infrastructure that will accelerate the change While AI provides the intelligence, FiDA provides the fuel. The Financial Data Access Regulation , currently under negotiation and slated to roll out by 2027, is designed to standardize and mandate access to a wide range of consumer financial data – not just payment accounts, but mortgages, pensions, insurance, investments, and digital assets. It’s the most ambitious open finance framework in the world. It mandates secure, real-time, customer-consented data sharing through APIs across all relevant financial domains. Critically, FiDA doesn’t stop at viewing data. It enables real-time, programmable access and unlocking a new layer of proactive financial automation. This is the enabler for continuous, intelligent financial management by agentic AI. A Strategic Crossroads for Incumbents This raises existential questions for traditional financial institutions. Who will own the agentic layer? Will banks, insurers, and asset managers invest fast enough to embed AI agents in their core products? Or will tech companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, combine platform reach with licensed fintechs and regulated infrastructure providers to take over the front-end? There’s a real risk that banks and insurers get pushed into the background. Reduced to utility providers that deliver compliance, capital, and risk infrastructure while others own the customer relationship. Financial institutions must now ask: What’s our model in a soon-to-be agentic, API-native, customer-driven future? Do we lead, collaborate, or retreat to back-end relevance? And If You’re Betting on In-Person Advice… If your core differentiator today is offering in-branch, in-person advice across customer segments, it’s time for a wake-up call. That model may work now, but it’s increasingly misaligned with what customers will expect in five years. AI agents will deliver better personalization, more consistency, 24/7 responsiveness, and close to zero marginal cost per user. They will scale trust, not just touch. Younger generations already expect seamless digital experiences. They’re very unlikely to trade that for a physical branch visit, especially when a digital agent can optimize their entire financial life in seconds. What feels like a strength today may very well become a strategic liability in the future. This Isn’t Just a Technology Shift. It’s a Business Model Reset The rise of agentic AI is more than a UX improvement. It is democratizing access to high-quality financial decision-making. Something historically reserved for the wealthy or financially literate. Everyday consumers get a digital expert advisor managing their financial lives. Small businesses gain intelligent CFO-like agents handling invoicing, cash flow, and credit optimization. Large firms empower treasury and finance teams with autonomous, adaptive execution systems. Financial advisors, brokers, and intermediaries must brace for impact. The personalization, transparency, and always-on nature of AI agents may outcompete even the most trusted human advisor. The Bottom Line My point: FiDA is not just another regulation. It’s the platform on which the next decade of financial services will be built. It gives rise to a new competitive arena. If you’re a financial institution, you might face a challenge: define the agentic future or become infrastructure for someone else’s. The technology is here. The data rails are coming.

How new generations are driving change in the Nordics | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers How new generations are driving change in the Nordics The payments landscape in the Nordics is changing fast. High digital maturity, evolving consumer expectations, and rapid innovation are reshaping how people pay, save, and interact with financial services. Younger generations such as Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennials are leading this shift, setting new standards for convenience, control, and personalization. Digital payments are now the default In the Nordics, digital payments have become the everyday norm. More than 90% of consumers have made an online purchase, and mobile is now the primary channel for both shopping and payments. Local wallets like MobilePay, Swish, and Vipps are as familiar as credit cards. Half of all consumers use mobile payments in-store. This behavior reflects a broader cultural expectation: people want to manage their finances independently, using trusted devices and platforms. Nexi’s Nordic Payments 2025 – H1 Preview study confirms that this trend is consistent across age groups. What younger generations expect Gen Z and millennials consider digital banking essential. More than half say it is a top priority when choosing a financial institution. They expect mobile onboarding, personalized services, and intuitive interfaces. Gen Alpha, the youngest cohort, is already engaging with financial services through teen-focused products that offer gamified learning, parental controls, and simplified digital tools. These generations have grown up with smartphones and instant access to information. They value speed, transparency, and relevance. Generic offerings don’t hold their attention. They want tools that help them learn, manage money, and make informed decisions. Many are skeptical of traditional banks and quick to switch providers if expectations aren’t met. From cards to digital ecosystems The payment card is evolving into a gateway for broader financial experiences. Today’s users expect instant digital issuing, travel perks, buy now pay later options, and sustainability features. Neobanks and fintechs have raised the bar for speed and mobile-first convenience. Traditional banks are adapting, often through modular platforms that allow faster response to changing demands. Nordic consumers move fluidly between online and in-store shopping. Electronics and clothing are typically bought online, while groceries and daily essentials remain in-store purchases. However, poor checkout experiences still lead to abandoned carts. Nexi’s report highlights the importance of frictionless payments across all channels. Security and trust remain critical As digital payments become more widespread, security and trust are top priorities. While many embrace mobile payments for their ease, others hesitate due to concerns about data privacy and fraud. Features like real-time notifications, advanced fraud prevention, and easy card controls are now expected. Providers must simplify complexity while maintaining strong security. Solutions that balance usability with protection help build and sustain consumer trust. The future of payments is increasingly shaped by data Across Europe and beyond, financial institutions are using behavioral insights to improve user experiences, reduce friction, and deliver more relevant services. Personalization is becoming standard, especially among younger consumers who expect intuitive interfaces, tailored rewards, and flexible payment options. Recent industry reports show that features like gamified learning, real-time notifications, and embedded loyalty programs are gaining traction. These tools help users make informed decisions and build financial confidence. For banks and fintechs, the challenge is to deliver these experiences at scale while maintaining trust and security. Platforms that support modular APIs, instant onboarding, and customizable features are helping financial providers respond quickly to changing expectations. Whether it’s offering teen-focused products or ESG-linked spending tools, the goal is the same: to make payments smarter, more engaging, and more aligned with individual needs. Collaboration and ecosystems shape the future Meeting consumer expectations requires collaboration. The most successful banks and fintechs are those that integrate, adapt, and innovate together. Modular platforms, open APIs, and partnership-driven models enable faster development and better customer outcomes. The focus is shifting toward ecosystems where value is shared, and innovation is collective. Simplifying payments for people and banks As payment technology evolves in the Nordics, the real value is seen in how it makes everyday transactions easier for people and enables banks to deliver better experiences. By focusing on simplicity and trust, the industry is helping everyone manage their finances with greater confidence.

Danske Bank and FinanceKey Deliver Real-Time Treasury for Enterprise Customers | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Press release - EMBARGOED until September 22nd 2025, at 6:00 AM CET Danske Bank and FinanceKey Deliver Real-Time Treasury for Enterprise Customers Copenhagen, September 2025: Danske Bank today announced a collaboration with FinanceKey to deliver realtime access to liquidity data, enabling CFOs and treasury teams to operate with greater speed, accuracy, and foresight. The collaboration underscores Danske Bank’s growing role as a key bank partner within the financial ecosystem – helping corporate customers unlock the full potential of embedding financial services within any system. This reflects a broader industry shift. According to PwC’s 2025 Global Treasury Survey, cash and liquidity management remain the top priorities for CFOs and treasurers, with 65% of organisations planning to expand API use in the coming years. Treasury teams are evolving from support functions into strategic decisionmakers, requiring access to trusted, real-time data. “With our Premium APIs, we want to help financial teams predict the future, not just describe the past,” said Johan Wennerberg, Head of Cash Management at Danske Bank. “As part of our Forward’28 strategy, we are embedding financial services directly into the systems our customers already use. This approach is designed to make daily financial operations smoother, faster, and more resilient, enabling CFOs to make better decisions in a rapidly changing environment.” Real-Time Treasury at Scale As part of the integration, FinanceKey is piloting Danske Bank’s new Premium Account Transaction & Balance API, giving their joint corporate customers real-time visibility of liquidity across multiple accounts in a single dashboard. Access real-time data: Instantly view transactions and balances across Danske Bank accounts. Automate reporting: Save manual hours by streamlining liquidity reporting, cash flow analysis, and alerts. Strengthen decision-making: Gain immediate visibility into cash positions to drive healthier, data-led businesses. “Danske Bank’s boldness in embracing true collaboration is what sets this project apart,” said Macer Skeels, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of FinanceKey. “This is a real-world example of what happens when banks and fintechs stop talking and start building – not in isolation, but in collaboration with the financial teams who will use the technology. This is exactly the kind of approach the treasury technology ecosystem needs to deliver lasting value for customers.” Powering the Next Chapter of Financial Services This illustrates how financial services in the Nordic region are being reshaped by Premium APIs, real-time infrastructure, and ecosystem collaboration. Danske Bank’s integration services act as a single entry point for customers and third parties to seamlessly connect their systems with the bank – offering access to file solutions, regulatory APIs, and Premium API products that improve efficiency across payables, receivables, and reporting. “Through our Premium API pilot program, we’re co-developing solutions with customers and partners to ensure we address the real challenges financial teams face,” said Christie H. Kristensen, Integration Partnership Manager at Danske Bank. “This is how we support businesses in today’s data-driven economy: by providing the trusted infrastructure that enables smarter decisions.” By taking a platform-based approach and building a partner-led distribution model, Danske Bank is helping financial teams modernise operations and bridging the gap between finance and technology, breaking down data silos, and enabling agility. About Danske Bank As the preferred bank for Nordic corporate and institutional customers, Danske Bank release the potential in people and businesses by using the power of finance to create sustainable progress today and for generations to come. As the largest bank in Danmark, we are committed to using our expertise and size to drive scale – alone and in partnership with others – while creating volume by encouraging and inspiring our customers to use their power.

Nordic Roots, Global Ambition: Going Beyond Compliance to Build Resilient Growth | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Nordic Roots, Global Ambition: Going Beyond Compliance to Build Resilient Growth By Daniel Alter, Chief Risk Officer at Enfuce The Nordic region has long approached compliance not as red tape, but as a springboard for innovation. By embedding high standards early and nurturing a culture of collaboration, it laid the foundations for digital infrastructures that are now seamlessly woven into everyday life. Consider Denmark’s MitID , the national digital identity system. Trusted by over 5 million people, 96% of the Danish population over the age of 15, it allows citizens to securely access public services, manage bank accounts, sign documents, and verify their identity across a wide range of digital platforms. Similarly, Sweden’s BankID supports 8 million users, 99.9% of people aged 18 to 67, and in 2024 alone enabled 7.6 billion identifications and digital signatures. These platforms are far more than security tools. They are national trust infrastructure: unlocking access, driving inclusion, and accelerating the adoption of digital services at scale. And they show something powerful: compliance, when done right, doesn’t slow innovation, it unlocks it. It builds the trust and stability that allow technology to scale responsibly and sustainably. The challenge: borderless risks demand borderless resilience The Nordic model is built on collaboration. Banks, fintechs, and regulators have long worked together to create unified infrastructure and shared standards that strengthen the entire ecosystem. But today’s financial system is global, and so are its risks. Financial crime, from fraud to money laundering, is evolving faster than any single regulator can contain. It is more sophisticated, more scalable, and more dangerous than ever, with criminal networks exploiting every gap between jurisdictions. Addressing these challenges requires more than regional defenses. It demands resilience that crosses borders: replacing isolated compliance efforts with shared frameworks, and shifting from reactive monitoring to coordinated, real-time collaboration across companies, regulators, and markets. At Enfuce , we believe this Nordic approach, compliance-first and collaboration-led, is no longer just a regional advantage. It is a global necessity. Our philosophy: compliance as foundation, risk management as enabler Compliance is often misunderstood. To many, it represents cost, friction, and delay, and too often it’s reduced to a box-ticking exercise. But experience across the Nordics, and at Enfuce, shows the opposite. When treated as a strategic foundation rather than an afterthought, compliance becomes an engine of growth. It is not just about meeting today’s requirements, it is about building the structures that allow businesses to adapt, anticipate, and scale. The reason is simple: global ambition cannot succeed on shaky ground. A single regulatory failure can halt expansion, erode trust, and irreparably damage reputations. Companies that see compliance as part of their core strategy, however, enter markets faster, gain regulator confidence, and build resilience that lasts. This belief is why we don’t just talk about compliance as strategy, we prove it in practice. Our pledge: Fortitude as proof point To take this philosophy from principle to practice, we launched the Fortitude Pledge : Enfuce’s promise to raise the bar on compliance and accountability. Through the Fortitude Pledge we commit to: ● Screen 100% of card transactions ● Flag 100% of high-risk activity ● Block 100% of prohibited payments ● Report 100% of suspicious cases ● Train 100% of our employees in AML/CTF best practices Most importantly we are putting 100% of our efforts into raising the bar and combating financial crime. The Fortitude Pledge proves that Nordic principles can be turned into global standards. With Allpay as our first signatory, we are calling on other financial institutions, businesses, and industry leaders to move beyond box-ticking compliance and join us in setting a new benchmark for trust. Global ambition: exporting Fortitude with Enfuce The future of finance will not be defined by speed alone, but by the ability to scale securely, sustainably, and with integrity. That is the standard Enfuce is taking to a global stage. Share article LinkedIn Blog Press FAQ Speakers 2025 Our Terms and Conditions © Copyright NFW all rights reserved",

Reassessing fintech dominance in the Nordics, from first movers to best-integrators | Nordic Fintech Week Skip to content Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Events Events Program About Startups Startups Awards Content Blog Video Partners Speakers Reassessing fintech dominance in the Nordics, from first movers to best-integrators Are the Nordics maintaining their dominance in the European fintech revolution? The signs are positive and point to an ecosystem of sleek cards, instant transfers and cashless cafés where innovation quietly becomes accepted and expected infrastructure. The Nordics were early and relentless, quickly turning good ideas into nationwide utilities. As the rails evolve again, the more relevant question isn’t whether banks or fintechs “win,” but whether the region can keep turning collaboration into a competitive edge. The secret sauce wasn’t one app or a specific technological innovation; it was productising trust leveraging several components: Decades of high digital literacy Cooperative banking cultures, National digital identity schemes Together, this created a canvas where complex financial plumbing could be abstracted into everyday magic. A population hungry for seamless, secure and speedy digital solutions was kept satisfied by a progressive wave of digital infrastructure – and enabled by impressive connectivity access and one of the highest smartphone penetrations anywhere globally [1] . Bringing these digital dreams to life For example, Vipps in Norway, and MobilePay in Denmark didn’t merely make peer-to-peer payments easy; they normalised real-time, low-friction experiences at national scale. Crucially, even when startups owned the front end, banks supplied balance-sheet strength, licenses, and compliance backbones. It looked like disruption, but it was also orchestration—multiple actors performing to a shared tempo. This leads us to the next act. Money in motion is fragmenting across more endpoints than ever. Payment volumes are increasingly flowing away from banks and towards Fintechs. That line captures a structural shift. Volumes used to sit neatly inside bank-owned cards, accounts, and clearing systems. Today, flows route through wallets, super-app checkouts, embedded finance in marketplaces, and account-to-account rails abstracted behind APIs. Consumers don’t think about issuers and acquirers; they think about “tap, send, done.” Fintechs own that moment—and often the data exhaust that follows. Nordic banks, more than most, are comfortable as utility-grade platforms. They hold licenses, deposits, compliance capabilities, and risk models that remain hard to replicate. Many fintechs in the region still anchor on bank infrastructure—directly or via network partners—for settlement finality, KYC, safeguarding, and float management. The centre of gravity, however, is moving toward whoever controls the experience layer and the orchestration logic behind it. So, while the Nordics remain in a strong position, the region’s edge is narrowing. Instant payments, open banking, and digital identity are now global playbooks. Markets from the UK to Brazil to India have scaled comparable rails and cultivated aggressive fintech ecosystems. The Nordic advantage is evolving from first mover to best-integrator. What does “happy symbiosis” look like in practice? Banks become programmable. Think API-first credit, real-time disbursements, and compliance-as-a-service that fintechs can snap into. Fintechs become regulated-adjacent. They lean into partnerships, share telemetry, and design for supervisory visibility from day one. Networks stitch it together. Push-to-account and account-to-account corridors blur card and non-card boundaries, letting value move to where users are—apps, wallets, platforms—without frictions the user can feel. In this model, the battleground is context and consent. Whoever assembles the cleanest data, earns permission to act on it, and returns value quickly will be in a position to win the next increment of payment flow. Nordic players—incumbent and insurgent—are well suited to this because the culture already prizes secure interoperability over walled gardens. The Nordics weren’t alone in spearheading this technological revolution, but they were early, disciplined, and pragmatic. Are they still leading? In the art of turning collaboration into competitive advantage, yes. The ground is shifting, but this is a region that has learned to pour the concrete while it walks on it. The result is not banks versus fintechs; it is an ecosystem where trust moves at the speed of software, and where winners make safe feel simple, again and again.
