Similarly, Sweden’s BankID supports 8 million users, 99.9% of people aged 18 to 67, and in 2024 alone enabled 7.6 billion identifications and digital signatures.

It is more sophisticated, more scalable, and more dangerous than ever, with criminal networks exploiting every gap between jurisdictions.

To many, it represents cost, friction, and delay, and too often it’s reduced to a box-ticking exercise. But experience across the Nordics, and at Enfuce, shows the opposite. When treated as a strategic foundation rather than an afterthought, compliance becomes an engine of growth.

When placed at the center of digital architecture, identity becomes the unifying layer that connects systems, governs access, and enforces rules consistently across every channel. Anchoring innovation in identity means data can be linked to people and entities, rather than scattered across silos.

Data Strategy Just Got Real. For years, data has been called the new oil. But in financial services, it’s been closer to crude, valuable, yes, but hard to refine, siloed, and often more liability than asset. Now, with the arrival of the EU’s AI Act, the stakes have changed. Regulation isn’t just about compliance anymore. It’s about survival.

According to Jason Yung, Head of Data Strategy at AWS for EMEA, most firms aren’t ready. “When we ask organisations what’s stopping them from becoming data-driven, they’ll usually point to data quality,” he says. “But often, the real issue is a lack of alignment around what they’re trying to do with the data in the first place.” This disconnect between data ambition and execution is widespread. Many institutions have centralised data teams and invested heavily in storage, data lakes, warehouses, cloud infrastructure, but are still struggling to translate that into business value. The issue? Strategy. “Centralising data teams creates bottlenecks,” Yung explains. “But decentralising too much leads to duplication, inefficiency, and shadow IT. What’s needed is a hybri",

What’s needed is a hybrid model, multidisciplinary teams that align on purpose and outcomes first.” From Platform Obsession to Product Thinking There’s also a shift underway in how firms approach technology. Many still operate with a platform-first mindset, collecting features without clear use cases. Yung challenges that. “Organisations need to stop thinking about platforms and start thinking about products,” he says. “Treat AI and data like a product, with ingredients, purpose, and transparency.” The AI Act reinforces this shift. Explainability, traceability, and auditability aren’t optional, they’re required. And that means the way organisations build, deploy, and scale AI must fundamentally change.

It becomes a lightweight governance layer, not replacing human oversight, but augmenting it.” This shift unlocks efficiency while reinforcing compliance.

An agent that detects unusual purchase behaviour—say, a sudden shift from grocery transactions to high-value goods—can alert a fraud investigator instantly. These agents are reusable, trainable, and far more flexible than traditional rule-based systems. “The beauty of agentic AI is that it’s not locked into one function,” Yung explains. “The same architecture can support personalisation, fraud detection,",

Regulatory expectations are rising, criminals are becoming more sophisticated, and customer demands for seamless digital experiences are intensifying. Traditional rule-based systems for detecting suspicious activity are no longer enough. They generate too many false positives, miss nuanced patterns and struggle to adapt to new threats. Many financial institutions do not have an overall company-wide view of financial ",

Where AI Can Make the Biggest Impact AI has the potential to transform financial crime detection and prevention across several key areas: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) AI can dramatically improve transaction monitoring by reducing false positives and identifying complex laundering patterns that span multiple accounts, geographies and transaction types.

Automation vs. Human Judgment: Finding the Right Mix While AI and automation solutions can automate and accelerate many aspects of financial crime management, it’s not a standalone silver bullet. There are critical areas where human expertise remains essential: Contextual Decision-Making : AI can flag anomalies, but understanding the context, especially in complex cases, often requires human judgment. For example, we have clients who are having their relationship managers train AI for certain word and acronym association with different clients. Regulatory Interpretation : Compliance isn’t just about ticking boxes. It involves interpreting evolving regulations and applying them to specific scenarios, which AI alone can’t do.

Model Governance : AI models need to be trained, tested and monitored. Bias, drift, and explainability are ongoing concerns that require skilled oversight. This also links to both external regulatory and internal oversight and evidencing.

The Compliance Challenge: Automating Without Overstepping One of the biggest hurdles in applying AI to financial crime is compliance. Regulators and internal audit teams are increasingly scrutinising how AI is used, especially in areas like AML and fraud detection. Transparency, explainability and auditability are non-negotiables. Banks must ensure that AI-driven decisions can be explained to regulators, customers and internal stakeholders. This means investing in model documentation, validation frameworks and governance processes. It also means being cautious about over-automation. For example, automatically freezing accounts based on AI alerts without human review could lead to reputational damage and customer dissatisfaction. ",

AI agents will deliver better personalization, more consistency, 24/7 responsiveness, and close to zero marginal cost per user. They will scale trust, not just touch. Younger generations already expect seamless digital experiences. They’re very unlikely to trade that for a physical branch visit, especially when a digital agent can optimize their entire financial life in seconds. What feels like a strength today may very well become a strategic liability in the future. This Isn’t Just a Technology Shift.

Small businesses gain intelligent CFO-like agents handling invoicing, cash flow, and credit optimization. Large firms empower treasury and finance teams with autonomous, adaptive execution systems. Financial advisors, brokers, and intermediaries must brace for impact. The personalization, transparency, and always-on nature of AI agents may outcompete even the most trusted human advisor. The Bottom Line My point: FiDA is not just another regulation. It’s the platform on which the next decade of financial services will be built. It gives rise to a new competitive arena.

At Enfuce , we believe this Nordic approach, compliance-first and collaboration-led, is no longer just a regional advantage. It is a global necessity. Our philosophy: compliance as foundation, risk management as enabler Compliance is often misunderstood. To many, it represents cost, friction, and delay, and too often it’s reduced to a box-ticking exercise. But experience across the Nordics, and at Enfuce, shows the opposite. When treated as a strategic foundation rather than an afterthought, compliance becomes an engine of growth. It is not just about meeting today’s requirements, it is about building the structures that allow businesses to adapt, anticipate, and scale. The reason is simple: global ambition cannot succeed on shaky ground. A single regulatory failure can halt",

Companies that see compliance as part of their core strategy, however, enter markets faster, gain regulator confidence, and build resilience that lasts. This belief is why we don’t just talk about compliance as strategy, we prove it in practice. Our pledge: Fortitude as proof point To take this philosophy from principle to practice, we launched the Fortitude Pledge : Enfuce’s promise to raise the bar on compliance and accountability. Through the Fortitude Pledge we commit to: ● Screen 100% of card transactions ● Flag 100% of high-risk activity ● Block 100% of prohibited payments ● Report 100% of suspicious cases ● Train 100% of our employees in AML/CTF best practices Most importantly we are putting 100% of our efforts into raisin",
